//Mini Challenge
// In the same way that we added a primary and secondary prop to the two Buttons, can
// you add two circles, or â€˜Iconsâ€™ below the Buttons, but make them as a functional
//component that we import into the Content Component. I want the primary Icon to
//be Green and the secondary to be Yellow.

//Mini Challenge
// In this mini challenge I would like you to help me out for the next section by
// adding two plain white buttons with the words 'Click me' in each below the word
// Section. Please use the approach we have learnt today.
// We will need this for the next scrim.
