//Mini Challenge
//based on the if else statement for the status, can you add your own if else statement
//that will render the green button like a traffic light, based on a prop we pass
//through? Please get rid of the 'primary' prop that controls the background-color to
//do this.

//Mini Challenge
//Based on the way we added a border to the Primary Icon, can you make the default
//border blue.

//Mini Challenge
// In the same way that we over-rode the style of the Title Component, I would like
// you to do the same for the SubTitle component, and make a ParagraphTitle that
//is grey. Put it at the bottom of the Section.

//Mini Challenge
// In the same way that we added a primary and secondary prop to the two Buttons, can
// you add two circles, or â€˜Iconsâ€™ below the Buttons, but make them as a functional
//component that we import into the Content Component. I want the primary Icon to
//be Green and the secondary to be Yellow.

//Mini Challenge
// In this mini challenge I would like you to help me out for the next section by
// adding two plain white buttons with the words 'Click me' in each below the word
// Section. Please use the approach we have learnt today.
// We will need this for the next scrim.
